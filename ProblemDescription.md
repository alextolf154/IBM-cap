### Analysis of how the immigration demographics of a city effect its Restaurant cuisines. ###

**What will this project do?**
It is a well known fact that *immigration* has an impact on available *cuisines*, what this project tries to show is whether or not that impact is fully compatible with the data. 
1. How strongly do the two *relate*? 
2. Are there anomylous regions' cuisines that are not reflected within the population Toronto, Ca.

**How will we do this?**
We will do this by creating a simple *visualisation* of Venue type, based on *Foursquare* data that would be used to gain insights into the number of restaurants that are within each specific postal code. This woudld give an excellent blanket representation of Toronto's food scene and the make up of its *various cuisines*. and then plotting it with *Immigrant numbers* in the Toronto, Ca population. Both will be *normalised into a percentile* of total restaurants and total population respectively. 

**Who would be interested in this idea**
The audience of this analysis would be stakeholders in a *Restaurant chai*n that is looking *to diversify* their cuisines to reflect thier *customer demographic*. The Restaurant business is one fo the most clear cut cases of supply and demand in the economic word. By having a large macro overview of a city populations demographic comparing it to the relative amount of restaurants it would allow for a more informed decision when it comes to diversification.
