### Description of Data, and how it will be used ###

**The Data that I will use**
The data that I will need to use is twofold. The first will be Immigration Data, that will be sourced from a Canadian Cencus (2016) and cleaned to show a simplified image of immigration from certain regions. 

I will then use Foursquare Venue data to gain an overview of the cuisines used in Toronto, by completing a search using postcodes and a 500m area surrounding thier longitude and latitudes. 

The hope will be that the combination of these two things will give me enough data to create a visually sturdy bar graph that will allow for a direct comparison. The problems that I may face is trying to seperate immigration and venue data into a large enough number of regions to produce a useable graph. 

**How will this data be used to solve my problem?**
This data will allow me to create a dataframe containing normalised percentiles of the venues' cuisines and immigrants' origin to visually compare the two ideas. This will then allow us to determine whether there is any correlation. If I am able to create a graph that shows genuine immigration demographics and genuine cuisine demographics in a comparable manner I should be able to visually determing whether the ideas that this project are based on are true and make statements about whether or not certain regions
